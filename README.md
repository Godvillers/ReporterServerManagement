This repo is only needed if you run the [Reporter Server][gvrepsrv] with Docker.

Code here runs on a host system (as opposed to running inside a container). That means
**these scripts may potentially damage your system**! Read through them carefully.

**Do not automatically pull** from this repository! Always examine the diffs beforehand.
